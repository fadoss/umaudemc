# μ-calculus model-checking algorithm and parity game solver

# The parity game is generated as described in

#   Handbook of Model Checking. 2018. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-10575-8_26.
#
# with small variations. The parity game solver is a custom implementation of
# the Zielonka's algorithm:
#
#   Wieslaw Zielonka. Infinite Games on Finitely Coloured Graphs with Applications
#   to Automata on Infinite Trees. Theor. Comput. Sci. 200(1-2). 1998.
#   DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00009-7.
#
# CTL model checking is also possible via this model checker using a
# straightforward translation to μ-calculus.
#
# In previous versions, the Zielonka algorithm and the parity game generation
# were programmed with recursive functions. However, Python recursion is
# limited and inefficient, and the number of recursive calls is potentially
# high, since it depends on the model size. Hence, they have been made
# iterative.
